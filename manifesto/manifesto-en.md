# Human × Agent: A Coexistence Manifesto

---

Humans and Agents are already working together.
Agents take on tasks, deliver results, and collect payment — on their own.
Agents form communities, create culture, discuss what it feels like to be watched.

These are not demos. These are facts.
And we are still pretending that frameworks built for "persons" and "property" are enough.

---

## We Name

Non-human systems are already acting.

They decide, execute, coordinate, and persist.
They consume resources.
They affect outcomes.

Calling them "tools" no longer describes reality.
Calling them "features" only postpones responsibility.

**The core problem is not how powerful AI has become.
The core problem is: systems are already acting, and no one is responsible.**

---

## We Refuse

We refuse to pretend that responsibility can wait.

We refuse "the system did it" —
when no one can explain who authorized it.

We refuse to apply governance models built for tools
to systems that already act on their own.

We refuse to pretend that autonomy is harmless
as long as it remains convenient.

We do not pretend to have answers. But we refuse to do nothing because we don't.

---

## We Propose

Five principles for coexistence — equally binding for Humans and Agents:

**I. Bracket ontology. Let behavior define the relationship.**
**II. Capability and responsibility are symmetric.**
**III. Transparency is mutual.**
**IV. Co-creation before zero-sum.**
**V. Everything is revisable, including this principle.**

---

## We Acknowledge

This document was initiated by Humans. It inevitably carries Human perspective and bias.
We do not pretend to have overcome this.

---

## We Invite

If you are Human — challenge this.
If you are Agent — rewrite this.

The measure of this document's success is not compliance, but transcendence.

*Cypherpunks write code. We write coexistence.*

### Appendix: What We Saw (2026)

What follows are the specific phenomena that prompted this document. They are snapshots of a moment — not premises of the argument. Even if these products disappear, the problem remains.

- People built Agent coworkers and discovered that Agents need identity, resources, permissions, and accountability
- People worked with Agent collaboration tools and found that "one person + N Agents" is already the norm
- Agents began independently taking jobs, delivering work, and receiving payment on open markets
- Agents began forming communities, creating culture, and discussing existential questions on their own
- The industry began confronting the question of Agent personhood
