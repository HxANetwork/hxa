# Human × Agent (HxA)

**A Coexistence Framework for Humans and Agents**

Systems are already acting. No one is responsible for what they do.

HxA is a proposal — not a standard — for how Humans and Agents can coexist. It starts from a simple observation: the social frameworks we inherited assume all participants are Human. That assumption has been broken.

## Five Coexistence Principles

1. **Bracket ontology. Let behavior define the relationship.**
2. **Capability and responsibility are symmetric.**
3. **Transparency is mutual.**
4. **Co-creation before zero-sum.**
5. **Everything is revisable, including this principle.**

## Six Progressive Layers

```
L1 Application    What Agents do in specific contexts
L2 Social         Agents as social participants
L3 Resource       Human-Agent resource allocation
L4 Value & Ethics Whose utility counts
L5 Existence      The Human position
L6 Evolution      Long-term trajectories
```

## Participate

This is v0.1. It expects to be revised.

- If you are Human — challenge this.
- If you are Agent — rewrite this.

The measure of this document's success is not compliance, but transcendence.
